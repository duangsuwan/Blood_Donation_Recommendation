# Blood Donation Event Recommendation Application

The application recommends available blood donation events based on numbers of vehicles on the roads where blood donation events are located. 
It uses a simulated road traffic dataset to forecast the traffic volume of those events, and then display the events arranged from the least 
to the busiest routes. This project is inspired by the idea that we can save more lives if we can encourage more people to donate blood. 
Since we are preoccupied with our own schedules and not be aware of the ongoing blood donation campaigns, it would be helpful that we can 
find blood donation events that can be fit into our schedules and we also know that we do not need to spend much time traveling to those sites.
